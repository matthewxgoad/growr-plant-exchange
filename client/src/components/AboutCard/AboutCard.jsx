            Welcome to <span className={classes.growrName}>growr</span>, a plant
            exchange app with the focus of promoting community/local gathering
            and networking through the love of all things plant related.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the dependency on mobile apps rooted deep in our behaviors, we
            want to revitalize what it means to be part of and have the support
            of a community. Growr acts as a facilitator of "good neighbor vibes"
            by targeting the all your activities within a set radius - we're in
            support of face-to-plant interactions, not emoji-to-emoji. ðŸŒ±
          </p>

          <p>
            Exchanges are just to get you into first gear - trade seeds for
            clippings, give away some free aloe pups, request some strange
            succulent to add to the collection - grow not just new plants but
            also your community and hit up the farmer's market or start a new
            urban/community garden with your new-to-you neighbors!

          <span className={classes.growrName}>growr</span> was born as a coding
          boot camp project and brought together an awesome and diverse team.
          Originally envisoned as an application for locating and sharing
          community gardens, the team's creativity and hard work has seen it{" "}
          <em>grow</em> into more. At the beginning of the project Brandon,
          Riheel, and Pam focused more on the back end while Felicia and Matt
          worked on the front, but as the project progressed everyone worked on
          the <em>full stack</em> and got their code into all aspects of the
          site.
